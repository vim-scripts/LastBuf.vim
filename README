lastbuf.vim is a plugin to open last closed buffers.

You can reopen your last closed buffer by :LastBuf or `<c-w><c-z>`.

buffers closed with :hid will always be opened.

buffers closed with :e # :q :only :close :bun :bd will be reopened by default.

buffers closed with :bw (!!CAUTION) will never be reopened.
